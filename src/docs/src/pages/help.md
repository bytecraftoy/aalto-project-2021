# How to use the app?

## Topbar

On the top of every page there is navigation bar using which you can go to different pages. Registration, Login, Home and Logout

## Registering

Go to the site 'user/register' and create a user with your email, username and a password. Note that the username is not case sensitive and is unique.

## Logging in and out

After creating a user, go to '/user/login' and insert your email or username and password. Logout will become visible in the navigation bar after logging in.

**NOTE** In order to access the graph, you need to be signed in.

## Graph

The graph is the center of the app. All the elements will be displayed on it. In the graph you can zoom in and out using the mouse scroll wheel. To move around the graph, press the left mouse button, hold it and drag it to move around.

## Node

There are two ways to add a node

1. Type into the input box on the right the text you want to be seen on the node. Then press Create
2. You can press ctrl + left mouse button. The node will appear at the current location of your mouse. Type in the text and press Enter

To delete a node, press it once with the left mouse button and then press backspace

## Edge

You can connect nodes with edges. Node has two points: up and down (target and source circle respectively) denoted by a small circle. Move your mouse over one circle and then drag into another circle of a different node. An edge cannot be connected to the same type of circle. In other words, an edge must be connected to a target circle from one side and a source circle from the other. Letting go of an edge without attaching it gets deleted.

To delete an edge, move your mouse to either the source or target circle of the edge. Press left mouse button on it. The edge will turn darker which means it has been selected. Then press backspace.

A single node can have as many edges as there are nodes.
